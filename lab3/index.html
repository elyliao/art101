			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to create a local file structure and to add index.html files to both the art101 folder and the lab3 subfolder.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>My partner and I did not run into any big problems for this lab. The most difficult aspect of this lab was just formatting the images for the website -- it was difficult to make sure that the images were still legible without making them too large. Our solution for this was to take multiple screenshots instead of trying to fit everything into one image and to limit the width of the images: I chose to limit mine to 650 pixels while Hilton chose to limit his images to 500 pixels.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was rather straightforward since the art101 file structure and the index.html files were already provided to us by Professor Modes. Again, the biggest issue we had was with the images, but that was also solved rather quickly. Overall, this lab was fairly easy. </p>

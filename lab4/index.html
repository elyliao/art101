			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge we were tasked is to come up with a thorough way to plan out what we wanted to code using pseudocode. This is to not only make sure we understand pseudocode but that we can replicate it and use it. This is to ensure we have everything down we want to code instead of scrambling to think of what to do as we code.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We didn't have any problems with this lab other than finding a time where we were both available to work together.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>With this assignment, we believe the results speak for themselves. We were able to come up with a very thorough Pseudocode that went in depth into the game we might wish to code. Not only that, we also manage to come up with a thorough cookie psuedocode along with the game. We were able to work very well together despite the difference in times.</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>

					<p>This is what the pseudocode for our Rock, Paper, Scissors Game looks like:</p>

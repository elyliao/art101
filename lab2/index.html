			<h2>Darshaya and Elizabeth</h2>
			<p>I, Darshaya am new to working with CSS as a digital code for programming. I am looking forward to learning how to build and design a website from scratch! I want to be an entrepreneur and learn some basic coding skills for myself and my future business. This class is a great opportunity for entry-level design. As for Elizabeth, I am a 2nd year AGPM major with some experience working in Python from previous courses. I want to learn how to make my own portfolio website and I hope this course can teach me how to do that.</p>
